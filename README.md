**Abstract**

The city of San Diego has a mobile crisis response team (MCRT) to handle suicide, mental health and substance use crisis when calling their number for help; however, when faced with an emergency, the general population will call or text a three-digit 911 number resulting in police, EMT, and/or firefighters that aren’t equipped in the same manner. Misty Analytics will provide recommendations to improve the dispatch call process.

**Problem Statement**

As of March 11th 2023, there have been over 90,000 phone calls made to the San Diego Police Department for the year 2023. With the high influx of calls that the dispatch center has to respond to, these calls are categorized into priorities dependent on the situation assessed from the call followed by a dispatch of police accompanied by emergency medical services and fire department based on the disposition and call type codes. The city of San Diego has a mobile crisis response team (MCRT) to assist in suicide, mental health, drug, and alcohol-related crises; however, this team is contacted when calling a 10-digit number or 988, which is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline that will then provide support and can connect them to services in the area of where the caller lives. 

When emergencies occur, people call 911 because it’s ingrained into our memories unlike 988 or the 10-digit number for San Diego MCRT. Police, EMT, and firefighters are not equipped or properly trained to de-escalate and support mental health, drug, and alcohol-related crises from a psychological standpoint. The city of San Diego wants to improve the dispatch call process to be able to categorize emergencies and notify MCRT when calls are identified to be within their specialty to better utilize resources.
